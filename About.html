					<p class="">Having been fortunate enough to grow up with a fully functional computer at my disposal, I've learned very early on about my inclination towards tech. Whether it be story-writing in Word or learning how to connect all the cords between the CPU and the monitor, my curiosity led me to learn the very basics of computer hardware and software. This, paired with my aptitude for problem-solving, led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science and Business Management at the University of the Free State.</p>
					<p>I have always gained immense gratification from building things from scratch and seeing them through, so I believed that this degree would be the perfect opportunity to learn more about building things in tech, as well as satisfy an interest in entrepreneurship that arose during employment as a clerk, at a small stationery store in my home town, during the weekends and school holidays of my high school years.</p>
					<p>Over the course of my degree, I've learned about the integration of technology into the business environment, therefore I've grown to enjoy back-end development such as Software Development  using C#, Database Development and Management using SQL; front- and back-end Web Development using HTML, CSS and ASP.NET, Systems Design as well as business related subjects like Digital Marketing, Entrepreneurship and Small Business Management.</p>
					<p>My above average performance in Web Development and Database Management led to my appointment as a lab assistant, in my second year, to assist first year students with the practical HTML and CSS work. I was then appointed as a Lecturers Assistant for Database Management, in my third year, where I assisted in the marking of students' assignments and consultations for any questions they may have had. Both were instances where the managerial, organisational and communication skills I acquired during my employment as a clerk were put to good use; and during my appointment to the latter position, I gained valuable time and self management skills. </p>
					<p>I also joined the Information Technology Students Association (ITSA) at the Department of Computer Science and Informatics, where I helped coordinate Association events, an experience which aided in my ability to think fast and work well with others.</p>
					<p>Having completed my degree in the full 3 years, I am now a graduate doing freelance work for a small business, Esylife Lesotho, in my home town, to assist in data storage and the automation of most of their business processes. </p>
